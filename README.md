# Crop-Production-ML
This project dives into the science of precision agriculture, using machine learning to classify soil and environmental factors into yield-predictive clusters. By analyzing key nutrients (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium) along with environmental conditions (Temperature, Humidity, pH, Rainfall), we categorize each feature into Low, Medium, and High clusters, revealing insights into potential crop yields (High Yield, Medium Yield, Low Yield). This approach empowers data-driven farming decisions, maximizing yield forecasts based on soil health and environmental conditions.
